# Geoadaptation of Language Models üåç

This repository contains the code for the TACL 2024 paper [Geographic Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00652/120648/Geographic-Adaptation-of-Pretrained-Language).

# Usage 

To replicate the geoadaptation procedure, use the scripts `start_geoadaptation.sh` and `start_geoadaptation_mtl.sh`.


To replicate the experiment on fine-tuned geolocation prediction, use the scripts `start_geolocation.sh` and `start_geolocation_mtl.sh`.


To replicate the experiments on zero-shot geolocation prediction, use the script `start_zeroshot_geolocation.sh`.


To replicate the experiments on zero-shot dialect feature prediction, use the script `start_zeroshot_dialect.sh`.

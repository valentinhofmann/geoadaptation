# Geoadaptation

This repository contains the code for the paper [Geographic Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08565.pdf).

# Usage 

To replicate the geoadaptation procedure, use the scripts `start_geoadaptation.sh` and `start_geoadaptation_mtl.sh`.


To replicate the experiment on fine-tuned geolocation prediction, use the scripts `start_geolocation.sh` and `start_geolocation_mtl.sh`.


To replicate the experiments on zero-shot geolocation prediction, use the script `start_zeroshot_geolocation.sh`.


To replicate the experiments on zero-shot dialect feature prediction, use the script `start_zeroshot_dialect.sh`.

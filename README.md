# Geoadaptation of Language Models üåç

This repository contains the code for the TACL 2024 paper [Geographic Adaptation of Pretrained Language Models](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00652/120648/Geographic-Adaptation-of-Pretrained-Language).

# Usage 

The main code for conducting geoadaptation can be found in `src/main_geoadaptation.py`.

To replicate the geoadaptation experiments from the paper, use the scripts `src/start_geoadaptation.sh` and `src/start_geoadaptation_mtl.sh`.

To replicate the experiments on fine-tuned geolocation prediction from the paper, use the scripts `src/start_geolocation.sh` and `src/start_geolocation_mtl.sh`.

To replicate the experiments on zero-shot geolocation prediction from the paper, use the script `src/start_zeroshot_geolocation.sh`.

To replicate the experiments on zero-shot dialect feature prediction from the paper, use the script `src/start_zeroshot_dialect.sh`.
